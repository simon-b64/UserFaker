# AuthFaker

This service provides you with an username, an email and a password if you send it a get request.
The values will be stored in the header and in the content as a JSON-Object.
You can also just copy the code instead of requesting.

This service/code must only be used for legal activities.
I don't take response for any illegal activities conducted with my code.
